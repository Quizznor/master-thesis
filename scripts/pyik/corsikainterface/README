###  README --- CorsikaReader/
#
## Author: Javier Gonzalez

Python wrapper for a Corsika file reader utility. This is based on the Auger corsika reader with some modifications.

To use this you need SWIG and cmake. I have not added an 'install' target, so you can only compile it in place.

  cmake /path/to/source
  make

should be enough... then there are the two examples. For the plotting example you need PyRoot.
