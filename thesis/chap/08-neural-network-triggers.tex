\section{Motivation \& Design considerations}
\label{sec:motivation}

The station-level triggers in the previous chapter have been shown to perform well enough for the science case of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The combined 
operation of all triggers guarantee full detection efficiency of air showers from approximately $10^{18.5}\,\SI{}{\electronvolt}$ upwards.
